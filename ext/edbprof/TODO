A target / dependency edges for building harness deps (libedb, et. al.)

LLVM: -split-tasks: a task boundary placed at the very beginning of a function
in source code does not appear as the first instruction in the first basic block,
so the splitter pass splits the block. The instruction that's at the top
is an alloca. Should we include a special case that detects the task boundary
as at the top of the block even if it is preceded by alloca instructions?
Is this ok in general? Should there be other types of instructions included
in this special case?


Don't vendor dependencies of python modules: move sllurpsock's dependency on sllurpsock to edbprof/ext
